# Q & A

## What this protocol is not

1. Not a Quantum Coin Flip

This protocol does not generate randomness or determine who wins. Inspired by quantum coin flipping, it focuses instead on the state of winnings — where profits exist in superposition until collected. Stakes are settled immediately; only surplus (payouts) enters this probabilistic frame.

2. Not the Game

Games determine outcomes and set fair odds. This protocol doesn’t touch those mechanics. Instead, it activates after the win — modeling how profits behave as latent, probabilistic value until gathered. Think of it as the quantum layer beneath a fair game.

3. Not a Synchronized Casino

No global clock. No sequence of truth. This protocol rejects both central and decentralized sequencing — outcomes emerge from peer-observed collapses, not ordered events.

## What this protocol is about

The Winner’s Dilemma — Choice Between Certainty and Confidence.

1. After Winning: Cash Out or Double Down

Winners face a choice: realize gains now, or re-enter with growing statistical confidence. This protocol encodes post-win behavior, not randomness — where trust in convergence, not luck, defines risk appetite.

2. Balance as Superposition

In systems like UTXO or Move, value isn’t continuous. Balances exist in fragmented, unresolved asset states — collapsing into measurable value only when explicitly used or queried.

3. Credits Collapse on Collection

Credits are not static coins — they’re latent potential. Like quantum states, they collapse into realized value only when redeemed.

4. The Law of Large Numbers as Engine

Fairness doesn’t come from randomness — it emerges from scale. Statistical convergence replaces central trust.

5. Peers Are the Witnesses

No house. No dealer. Only observers. Each peer contributes to outcome integrity through shared verification, not authority.

6. Confidence is the Currency

Winners build trust through repeated convergence. Confidence — not luck — becomes the fuel for continued play.

7. Casinos on Mars

Built for parallel futures. Each peer is a world. Energy flows across chains, times, and strategies — not by consensus, but by convergence. This is not just a protocol — it’s a physics of value.
